# Object-Oriented Programming Project <32/2><2>

### Description
This is an application for creating and managing online tests. Each test is created by a teacher, who will assign a unique name to each test, including the number of questions. Next, the questions will be entered, and they can either be multiple-choice or open-ended. Students can log in and take the tests from the list of available tests. Once the teacher has graded the tests, students will be able to view their results. The teacher will assign grades only to the open-ended questions, with a score ranging from 0 to a maximum score calculated by dividing 30 by the total number of questions.

### Note
Due to the lack of a database, in order to fully use the application, the windows should not be closed normally but by pressing the dedicated "exit" button located in both the teacher's and student's dashboards.

### Built with
- Visual Studio Code
- Eclipse new Java project plugin
